** Course Objectives
   - To solve problems using algorithms and flowcharts
   - To write, test, and debug simple Python programs.
   - To develop and execute programs using Python programming constructs.

** Suggestive Exercises
   1. Use Linux shell commands, use Python in interactive mode, and an
      editor
   2. Write simple programs (area of a geometric shape, simple
      interest, solve quadratic equation, net salary).
   3. Write programs using conditional statements (leap year, maximum
      of 2 numbers, maximum of 3 numbers, simple calculator, grade of
      the total mark).
   4. Develop programs using loops and nested loops (gcd, prime
      number, integer division, sum of digits of an integer,
      multiplication table, sum of a series, print patterns, square
      root using Newton's method).
   5. Develop programs using function (sine and cosine series,
      Pythagorean triplets).
   6. Develop programs using recursion (efficient power of a number,
      factorial, Fibonacci number).
   7. Develop programs using strings (palindrome, finding substring)
      without using in-built functions.
   8. Develop programs using list and tuples (linear search, binary
      search, selection sort, insertion sort, quicksort).
   9. Develop programs using nested lists (matrix manipulations).
   10. Develop simple programs using dictionaries (frequency
       histogram, nested dictionary).
   11. Develop programs using Files (read and write files).
   12. Develop programs to perform any task by reading arguments from
       command line.

** Course Outcomes
After the completion of this course, students will be able to:
- To write, test, and debug simple Python programs (K2).
- To implement Python programs with conditionals and loops  (K3).
- Use functions for structuring Python programs (K3).
- Represent compound data using Python lists, tuples, and dictionaries (K3).
- Read and write data from/to files in Python (K3).
